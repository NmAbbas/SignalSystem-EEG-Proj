# EEG Signal Analysis Using MATLAB

This project, completed as part of my Signals and Systems course, involves the analysis of EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals using MATLAB. The primary objectives were to preprocess the EEG data, apply various signal processing techniques, and extract meaningful features. The project demonstrates proficiency in MATLAB and a solid understanding of signal processing concepts.

## Phase 1: EEG Data Investigation and Analysis
In this phase, we were provided with raw EEG data and utilized the EEGLAB Toolbox to conduct a comprehensive investigation. Initially, we conducted research on the nature of EEG signals and the methodologies involved in recording such data. Following this introductory research, we employed a step-by-step guide to process our own data and extract valuable information.
