# EEG Signal Analysis Using MATLAB

This project, completed as part of my Signals and Systems course, involves the analysis of EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals using MATLAB. The primary objectives were to preprocess the EEG data, apply various signal processing techniques, and extract meaningful features. The project demonstrates proficiency in MATLAB and a solid understanding of signal processing concepts.
